`mean d` is the share of each task's withheld checks your episodes passed, minus the pinned model's share on the *same instances* with no strategy. Passing tasks is not the achievement — beating that baseline is. `Δc` is the lower bound of that difference, so beating the baseline on average is not enough to be *paid* for beating it.

### Check the grading yourself

6 of 6 withheld commitments re-verified at close: **all match**.

Each instance's withheld half was committed to *before* submissions opened, as `hmac-sha256(salt, canonical_json(withheld))`. The commitment is in the task record — under `rounds/<id>/tasks/` when you were shown the scored tasks, under `rounds/<id>/evaluated/` when you were shown previews — and `rounds/queue.json` carried the digest of those records before the round opened. The salt and the half itself are published now, in `reveal.json`. Recompute it and confirm the criteria you were graded against are the ones that were fixed in advance:

```python
import hashlib, hmac, json
salt, withheld = reveal[task_id]["salt"], reveal[task_id]["withheld"]
body = json.dumps(withheld, sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"), ensure_ascii=False).encode()
"hmac-sha256:" + hmac.new(bytes.fromhex(salt), body, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
```
